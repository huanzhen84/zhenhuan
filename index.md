## Personal information

Currently I'm an associate professor at [Center for Mathematical Sciences at Huazhong University of Science and Technology](http://mathcenter.hust.edu.cn/). I received my PhD from the [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign](https://math.illinois.edu/). My advisor was [Charles Rezk](https://faculty.math.illinois.edu/~rezk//). My dissertation defense was on May 5th, 2016.

I completed my BS in mathematics at [Peking University](https://www.math.pku.edu.cn).

Here is my [CV](Huan-CV.pdf).

## Research

My research interests are in algebraic topology, algebraic geometry and mathematical physics. 

Here is my [research statement](Huan_RS.pdf).
