## Personal information

Currently I'm an associate professor at [Center for Mathematical Sciences at Huazhong University of Science and Technology](http://mathcenter.hust.edu.cn/). I received my PhD from the [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign](https://math.illinois.edu/). My advisor was [Charles Rezk](https://faculty.math.illinois.edu/~rezk//). My dissertation defense was on May 5th, 2016.

I completed my BS in mathematics at [Peking University](https://www.math.pku.edu.cn).

## Students

I supervised two undergraduates of Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Lesi Hu (胡乐思) and Zhangqi Pan （潘章琦）, who attended the Mathematician Project A at HUST. 

During the spring semester of 2022, they attended the algebra seminar organized by me and studied Hungerford's Algebra book. During the fall  semester of 2022, they attended the joint algebraic geometry seminar organized by [Hao Sun](https://haosun71275.github.io/HaoSun/) and me, and discussed with 9 other students from 4 other universities in China, and studied the first two chapters of Hartshorne's Algebraic Geometry book. During this process they studied various related mathematical knowledge, including topology, manifolds and commutative algebra.

And they finished their project paper on specific topics in algebraic geometry at the end of 2022：

Lesi Hu, Computation about Zariski tangent space and its Application in Deformation theory

Zhangqi Pan, Extending a Sheaf by Zero



## For Graduates who are interested in working with me


If you want to work with me, you should have 

* Very strong motivation and passion towards algebraic topology

* Solid background in topology, abstract algebra and basic algebraic topology.

And you should be prepared for

* written exams, including topology, abstract algebra and basic algebraic topology.

* an oral exam, 15 minutes or longer if necessary.

* a practice meet. I will give you a paper to read and you present after one week.
