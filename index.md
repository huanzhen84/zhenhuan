## Personal information

Currently I'm an associate professor at [Center for Mathematical Sciences at Huazhong University of Science and Technology](http://mathcenter.hust.edu.cn/). I received my PhD from the [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign](https://math.illinois.edu/). My advisor was [Charles Rezk](https://rezk.web.illinois.edu/). My dissertation defense was on May 5th, 2016.

I completed my BS in mathematics at [Peking University](https://www.math.pku.edu.cn).

## Research

My research interests are in algebraic topology, algebraic geometry and mathematical physics. 

Here is [my nLab page](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/Zhen+Huan).

## Students

### Current Master Student：

Zhangqi Pan(潘章琦)

Research project: 3-vector spaces and 3-representations



### Master Student Candidates and their undergraduate projects: 

Zhi Wang(王志): Model category and homotopy theory

zhaobin Zhang（张兆斌）: Model category and higher category




### Undergraduate Research:
I supervised two undergraduates of Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Lesi Hu (胡乐思) and Zhangqi Pan (潘章琦), who attended the Mathematician Project A at HUST. 

During the spring semester of 2022, they attended the algebra seminar organized by me and studied Hungerford's Algebra book. During the fall  semester of 2022, they attended the joint algebraic geometry seminar organized by [Hao Sun](https://haosun71275.github.io/HaoSun/) and me, and discussed with 9 other students from 4 other universities in China. The students studied the first two chapters of Hartshorne's Algebraic Geometry book. Each of them gave a 2-hour talk. During this process they studied various related mathematical knowledge, including topology, manifolds and commutative algebra.

Lesi and Zhangqi finished their project paper on specific topics in algebraic geometry at the end of 2022：

* Lesi Hu, Computation about Zariski tangent space and its Application in Deformation theory

* Zhangqi Pan, Extending a Sheaf by Zero
